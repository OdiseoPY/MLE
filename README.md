# Demystifying MLE from scratch

This repo captures my from-scratch path into Machine Learning Engineering.Instead of jumping straight into prebuilt tools, I'm manually implementing core ML models and workflows, including linear regression, classification, SVMs, neural networks, and different model architectures.

The goal: understand every piece deeply—how models learn, optimize, and generalize. It’s not just about making things work, but about making sense of what’s working and why.

Raw. Ground-up. Focused on confidence over shortcuts.
