    - [x]  Revision
    - [x]  Improvements (**torch.nn.Module**)
        - [x]  first of all the init part since for working nn the weights/biases and the manual passes aren’t enough —> replace with `torch.nn.module` (use it’s functionality)
        - [x]  using *`torch.nn`'s* built in loss function, activations  for better optimization
        - [x]  replace the manual optimization with —> `torch.optim`
    - [x]  the nn module
    - [ ]  the torch.optim module (adhoc: still full implementation and tuning yet to explore )

 

1. nn module
2. torch.optim module
